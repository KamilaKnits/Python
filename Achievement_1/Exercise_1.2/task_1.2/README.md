# Task 1.2 

1. Data Structure recipe_1

I decided to go with dictionary as it stores the data in key: value pairs. It's a flexible structure for listing ingredients and makes it easy to organize and retrieve the data.

2. Data Structure all_recipes

I went with dictionary as well for the second data structure to just make it uniform. But using list would have also worked to preserve the order of recipes.
